Litium Polymer Battery Charging Neighbor

When operating a GreatFET under LiPo power from Jasmine, the voltage may drop under 3.3VDC.

The 10k resistors on R2 configures the charge current to be 100mA which is the fastest supported charge rate for many LiPo batteries. The charge rate can be reconfigured changing the R2 resistor or adding a resistor to R3.
